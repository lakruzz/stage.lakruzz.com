<p>Complexity is everywhere.</p>

<p>In a standard approach to software development, complexity is the meter that influences all others.</p>

<p>The simpler a solution is to implement, the faster the <em>Return On Investment</em>.</p>

<p>For each card ask yourself the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What would be required to implement this feature or ability, taking into account man hours, money spent up front, and ongoing cost of ownership?</p>

 The second level of complexity is something that can be achieved as a team effort, still within a project scope. It’s marked as a team effort <i class="fa-solid fa-user-group"></i>.</p>

 The third and highest level of complexity is something than can only be achieved with permission and funding from the line-organization. It’s too big for the project to handle within it’s own means and resources. It’s marked as a mountain to climb <i class="fa-solid fa-mountain-sun"></i> .</p>
