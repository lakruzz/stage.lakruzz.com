<p>For most software projects it’s the code’s complexity and technical debt that eventually makes it obsolete.</p>

<p>Every time we touch the code, we’re jeopardizing the original design and quality.
Either by adding quick solutions that don’t scale or because we simply don’t add non-functional ‘abilities’ to the solution.</p>

<p>Testability, traceability, maintainability, supportability, readability… These kinds of abilities.</p>

<p>We’re building up technical debt - debt that will have to be paid back or you’ll end up broke.</p>

<p>For each card ask yourself the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To what extent would implementing this feature or ability help to pay back on technical debt or actively prevent more debt from being added?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The payback is measured from one to three stars. Use the stars as follows:</p>

<p><span class="stars"><span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_empty"><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></span> <span class="s_empty"><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></span> </span></p>

<p>It sporadically affects <em>code snippets</em> at an individual level.</p>

<p><span class="stars"><span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_empty"><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></span> </span></p>

<p>It affects <em>design</em> at a team collaboration level.</p>

<p><span class="stars"><span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> </span></p>

<p>It affects <em>architecture</em> at a corporate asset level.</p>
