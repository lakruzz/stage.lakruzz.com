<p>Continuous attention to your surroundings will provide you with the means for you to reflect upon your current situation. Think - and then improve it.</p>

<p>Feedback can be in the form of logs, data, graphs, statistics, analysis, discussions with customers or colleagues - Anything that gives your surroundings a voice.</p>

<p>If your Continuous Delivery ecosystem or your application isn’t <em>talking</em> to you, then you’re trying to move forward while blindfolded, in the dark.</p>

<p>Give your surroundings a voice.</p>

<p>For each card ask yourself the following question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To what extent would implementing this feature or ability provide more feedback or visibility to the responsible worker and his colleagues?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The feedback is measured from one to three stars. Use the stars as follows:</p>

<p><span class="stars"><span class="s_filled"><i class="fa fa-star"></i></span> <span class="s_empty"><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></span> <span class="s_empty"><i class="fa fa-star-o"></i></span> </span></p>

<p>It sporadically affects the developer at an individual level.</p>

<p>It affects the entire team and collaboration.</p>
