        <p>Every time the code changes, it traces back to <em>some</em> task being done.
Think about it; Who’s feeding the process? How are tasks being created, prioritized and executed?</p>

<p>When a code change cannot be tied to a specific task, it’s likely something that has bypassed the normal chain of command. Somebody is working outside protocol.</p>

<p>Make all code changes part of an overall plan - simply pair commits with tasks. Besides generating valuable traces that can later be used in an audit or documentation of your trail, it also enables you to track the pace of the team and maintain a burn-down chart.</p>

        <p>To integrate means to merge your code on to the same branch as the one your colleagues are working on.  So obviously if your code breaks something you are potentially jeopardizing the work space - and pace - of your team mates as well. To have a pristine integration branch means that it is <em>buildable</em> at all times.</p>

<p>Code should be verified through some kind of toll-gate criteria, before it’s accepted on to the integration branch.
Anything that doesn’t meet the toll-gate criteria is rejected and will not enter the mainline.
It is simply impossible for a developer to <em>break the build</em>.</p>

        <p>The release train branching strategy is similar to what is sometimes referred to as <em>late branching</em> or <em>trunk based development</em>.
Essentially it implies that in your entire branch tree there is only <em>one</em> branch that is meant to be long-lived.</p>

<p>Consequently, there is only one way you can contribute to a product and have your code released, and that is to deliver your code to the mainline.</p>

<p>In a release train strategy, the mainline is on it’s way to production all the time, and therefore anything that isn’t meant for production as soon as possible, shouldn’t be delivered to the mainline.</p>

        <p>Distributed version control systems are a faster, modern alternative with a healthy community. Due to its distributed nature, switching to git opens up many doors to automation.
e.g.: It allows for automation tools to work in a local repository without jeopardizing the mainline.</p>

<p>Keep your project’s history clean and understandable. Make it easier to find specific commits and for others to review.  When finishing up work in your short-lived branches, clean up your local commit history before merging back into the integration branch.</p>

        <p>An <em>artifact</em> is <em>the output derived from your build process</em>.</p>

<p>Sadly, artifacts are often built whenever they’re needed.
A lot of the builds just build that which has been built before.</p>

<p>Even though this could be about contributing to avoiding the environmental crisis, it is also justifiable to save and manage artifacts simply to save wait-states and bottlenecks in the software development process.</p>

<p>Stop building things that haven’t changed and start reusing colleagues’ artifacts - install an artifact management system.</p>

        <p>When code changes are committed to the repository, your CI server kicks in automatically and starts a build.</p>

<p>It might not even be an actual <em>build</em>, it can be any kind of automated action that is part of a verification process implied in the project’s “definition of done”.</p>

<p>If a build step fails, the developer is notified directly so he can start working on fixing the issue immediately. The shorter the feedback loop, the better.</p>

        <p>Split up your builds and verifications into a pipeline consisting of multiple stages.
Use this approach to keep your builds as fast as possible, your feedback loop as short as possible and your developers notified as quickly as possible despite having long-running builds.</p>

<p>In your pipeline, each step provides more confidence in your code than the previous one.</p>

<p>Design you code, so it can produce an audit trail - a complete profile of states, sequences, data in and out. That should give you clues, when you try to do your code-scene forensics.</p>

<p>At least you’ll get some clues on how to reproduce the error in your development environment.</p>

        <p>Both successful deployment and functional testing are often considered part of the <em>definition of done</em>.</p>

<p>When we´re building continuous delivery pipelines it’s because we want our developers to have access to, and to execute, the full definition of done.</p>

<p>Use simulators, emulators, containers and VMs to verify your definition of done and ensure stable releases.
The closer to production your testing environment, the more confidence you can have in your changes.</p>

        <p>When your test cases are self-contained with individual <em>setups</em> and <em>tear-downs</em> and they trace to related functions and features, you are able to analyze a given change set, place it in context of a limited amount of features and derive its relevant test cases.</p>

<p>Then you can construct an adaptive test suite on the fly and execute that on a production-like environment.</p>

<p>By running a small and relevant subset of functional tests, you can add functional testing to the short feed-back loop.</p>

        <p>In a functional test, you test the features that the system offers as a whole, seen from the end user’s perspective.</p>

<p>In the previous millennium such a test would be planned by a person with domain knowledge, then executed prior to every release by testers performing manual operations based on written instructions.</p>

<p>A more contemporary strategy is to have the person with domain knowledge manage a team of developers, who are actually implementing the tests <em>as code</em>, and then give the software developers access to execute these test in their <em>production-like</em> environments.</p>

        <p>Management and maintenance of your test data is considered part of your Quality Assurance strategy. Your test data is versioned and stored as an artifact.</p>

<p>This implies that you separate your test data from the actual tests,
which in turn comes with the benefit of easily running test suites with different, versioned data sets.</p>

<p>Test suites becomes self-contained, each with their own easy reproducible <em>setup</em> and <em>tear-down</em> steps, something that will later enable you to run your test suites independently of each other - maybe even selected on output from previous verification steps in your pipeline.</p>

        <p>A word of precaution; <em>testing in production</em> is not to be confused with <em>releasing untested code</em>.</p>

<p>It starts with acknowledgement that all serious problems are discovered in production and occurred because unforeseen things happened.</p>

<p>Deliberately go to your production environment and do unforeseen things like turn off a server, kill a process, pour coffee on your keyboard, upgrade a service during high-load.</p>

<p>If your system is built to survive it, then it should! You’re only sure it will if you (dare) test it.</p>

        <p>Unit tests are used to test the semantics of your code; To verify it works as expected and keeps working as expected through changes.</p>

<p>Unit tests are light-weight and fast. Don’t get tangled up in hard-to-handle dependencies such as loading databases or instantiating long sequences of objects before you get to the actual testing, use mocks and stubs to simulate your first order dependencies. Or use Proxies to have non-local collaborators contribute to your test.</p>

<p>A unit test is quick to execute and it should be executable in the context of your development environment.</p>
