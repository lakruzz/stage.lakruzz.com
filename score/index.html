          <p>Every time the code changes, it traces back to <em>some</em> task being done.
Think about it; Who‚Äôs feeding the process? How are tasks being created, prioritized and executed?</p>

<p>When a code change cannot be tied to a specific task, it‚Äôs likely something that has bypassed the normal chain of command. Somebody is working outside protocol.</p>

<p>Make all code changes part of an overall plan - simply pair commits with tasks. Besides generating valuable traces that can later be used in an audit or documentation of your trail, it also enables you to track the pace of the team and maintain a burn-down chart.</p>

          <p>To integrate means to merge your code on to the same branch as the one your colleagues are working on.  So obviously if your code breaks something you are potentially jeopardizing the work space - and pace - of your team mates as well. To have a pristine integration branch means that it is <em>buildable</em> at all times.</p>

<p>Code should be verified through some kind of toll-gate criteria, before it‚Äôs accepted on to the integration branch.
Anything that doesn‚Äôt meet the toll-gate criteria is rejected and will not enter the mainline.
It is simply impossible for a developer to <em>break the build</em>.</p>

          <p>The release train branching strategy is similar to what is sometimes referred to as <em>late branching</em> or <em>trunk based development</em>.
Essentially it implies that in your entire branch tree there is only <em>one</em> branch that is meant to be long-lived.</p>

<p>Consequently, there is only one way you can contribute to a product and have your code released, and that is to deliver your code to the mainline.</p>

<p>In a release train strategy, the mainline is on it‚Äôs way to production all the time, and therefore anything that isn‚Äôt meant for production as soon as possible, shouldn‚Äôt be delivered to the mainline.</p>

          <p>Distributed version control systems are a faster, modern alternative with a healthy community. Due to its distributed nature, switching to git opens up many doors to automation.
e.g.: It allows for automation tools to work in a local repository without jeopardizing the mainline.</p>

<p>Keep your project‚Äôs history clean and understandable. Make it easier to find specific commits and for others to review.  When finishing up work in your short-lived branches, clean up your local commit history before merging back into the integration branch.</p>

          <p><em>Versioning schemes are a powerful tool.</em>
<br /><br />They give you a quick and accurate reference to when, where and by whom something was made, what it‚Äôs compatible with, etc.
It is the name of your release, the identifier of your component, the passport of your product.<br /><br />
Implement a well-defined versioning scheme for your components and releases.</p>

          <p>An <em>artifact</em> is <em>the output derived from your build process</em>.</p>

<p>Sadly, artifacts are often built whenever they‚Äôre needed.
A lot of the builds just build that which has been built before.</p>

<p>Even though this could be about contributing to avoiding the environmental crisis, it is also justifiable to save and manage artifacts simply to save wait-states and bottlenecks in the software development process.</p>

<p>Stop building things that haven‚Äôt changed and start reusing colleagues‚Äô artifacts - install an artifact management system.</p>

<p>The requirements that created the tasks, the commits that resolved them, the compiler that built them, the tests you ran, the environment you ran them in, the test results and so on.
When the software reaches production, you know the specifics of everything that created it.</p>

          <p>Analyzing your code is cheap but valuable. Scouring your code and producing interesting metrics helps you keep check on all kinds of creeping issues.</p>

<p>Static code analysis, style checkers, cyclomatic complexity, code coverage and scanning for FIXMEs and TODOs are all examples of metrics that help you keep a watchful eye on codebase evolution. Adding thresholds to these measures as part of your verification protects it from corruption.</p>

<p>Monitor improvements but don‚Äôt waste time reaching arbitrary targets.</p>

          <p>In a functional test, you test the features that the system offers as a whole, seen from the end user‚Äôs perspective.</p>

<p>In the previous millennium such a test would be planned by a person with domain knowledge, then executed prior to every release by testers performing manual operations based on written instructions.</p>

<p>A more contemporary strategy is to have the person with domain knowledge manage a team of developers, who are actually implementing the tests <em>as code</em>, and then give the software developers access to execute these test in their <em>production-like</em> environments.</p>

          <p>Management and maintenance of your test data is considered part of your Quality Assurance strategy. Your test data is versioned and stored as an artifact.</p>

<p>This implies that you separate your test data from the actual tests,
which in turn comes with the benefit of easily running test suites with different, versioned data sets.</p>

<p>Test suites becomes self-contained, each with their own easy reproducible <em>setup</em> and <em>tear-down</em> steps, something that will later enable you to run your test suites independently of each other - maybe even selected on output from previous verification steps in your pipeline.</p>

          <p>A word of precaution; <em>testing in production</em> is not to be confused with <em>releasing untested code</em>.</p>

<p>It starts with acknowledgement that all serious problems are discovered in production and occurred because unforeseen things happened.</p>

<p>Deliberately go to your production environment and do unforeseen things like turn off a server, kill a process, pour coffee on your keyboard, upgrade a service during high-load.</p>

<p>If your system is built to survive it, then it should! You‚Äôre only sure it will if you (dare) test it.</p>

          <p>Unit tests are used to test the semantics of your code; To verify it works as expected and keeps working as expected through changes.</p>

<p>Unit tests are light-weight and fast. Don‚Äôt get tangled up in hard-to-handle dependencies such as loading databases or instantiating long sequences of objects before you get to the actual testing, use mocks and stubs to simulate your first order dependencies. Or use Proxies to have non-local collaborators contribute to your test.</p>

<p>A unit test is quick to execute and it should be executable in the context of your development environment.</p>
